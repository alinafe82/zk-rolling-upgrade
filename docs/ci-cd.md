# CI/CD operations

## Required checks

Python 3.10–3.13 compatibility tests, Ruff format/lint, and package integrity.

All workflows use explicit token permissions, bounded runtimes, concurrency controls, and
immutable commit pins for external actions where actions are used.

## Failure notifications

The `CI Failure Alert` workflow creates or updates an issue assigned to the repository owner
when a monitored workflow fails or times out, and closes the issue after recovery. Assignment and
repository watching provide a durable GitHub notification trail.

For email delivery, enable **Settings → Notifications → System → Actions → Email**, select
**Only notify for failed workflows**, and watch this repository. GitHub owns this setting; workflow
YAML cannot force an account email destination. No SMTP credentials are required by this repo.

## Incident response

1. Open the linked failed run and identify the first failing job.
2. Reproduce its named command locally before changing the workflow.
3. Fix the product or workflow on a pull request; do not bypass a required check.
4. Confirm the default-branch recovery run closes the alert issue.
